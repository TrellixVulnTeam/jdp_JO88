## src
Source folder is where we keep our code for the app. Src siblings are public, build and node_modules. Node_modules are
project dependencies that we installed through npm. Build is a application compressed and optimized for production use. Public folder 
contains public images, files etc.

Index.js is our main page where we load our React components. serviceWorker.js is autogenerated by react.
